# Getting Started

UCM integrates with the following inference engines by plugging in a KV
connector / patched store at runtime. Each engine has its own quick start guide
covering installation, configuration, and launching inference.

## Which guide should I follow?

Pick the guide that matches the engine you use. All guides assume UCM is
already installed; if it is not, see the [Installation](../installation.md)
guide first.

## Building from source

If you prefer to build UCM from source code rather than using Docker images or
pip wheels, see [Building and Installing UCM from Source](../../developer-guide/build_from_source.md).
